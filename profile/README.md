Linear A makes machine learning viable on emergent execution environments. 
We are witnessing a marvel of machine learning transforming human productivity and creativity. However, [software and hardware restrictions make it nearly impossible for developers to harness these capabilities in emergent execution environments, notably zero-knowledge-proof systems.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nb5D6-EW_8McRkSGzUO5lwxZPvm6Rlx3eJyLn7DD6kI/edit?usp=sharing)

Linear A addresses the problems faced by this burgeoning trio of machine learning practitioners, system architects, and hardware designers through open-access, collaboratively-engineered initiatives.
